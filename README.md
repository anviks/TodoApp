# TodoApp

This solution contains a simple CRUD application that allows you to manage your tasks.
In addition to the CRUD operations, the application also allows you to mark tasks as completed,
sort tasks by title, category, description, priority, creation date and deadline,
and to filter tasks by any combination of title, category, description and priority.
It was made using Razor Pages and Entity Framework Core as an exam practical task (time limit: 8 hours).
